# MATLAB&#174; DocMaker :hatching_chick:

DocMaker is a tool for generating MATLAB toolbox documentation.

With DocMaker, you can:
* write documentation in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) and convert to HTML for viewing in MATLAB
* run MATLAB code blocks in documents and include textual and graphical output
* create MATLAB documentation index files from a Markdown table of contents

DocMaker ships with [documentation](./tbx/docmakerdoc/index.md), including [release notes](./tbx/docmakerdoc/changelog.md) that detail new features, bug fixes, and compatibility considerations for each version.
