# What is GUI Layout Toolbox?

GUI Layout Toolbox provides a package of MATLAB objects that allow for complex arrangement of graphical user interface elements within a figure window. The main capabilities provided are:
- Automatic element arrangement horizontally, vertically or in grids
- Ability to specify fixed sizes or resizing weights for each element
- Ability to "nest" layouts to produce virtually any element arrangement
- Divider bars for user-resizing of elements
- These element arrangement capabilities are designed to match those found as standard in other user-interface toolkits such as Java Swing, GTK, QT etc.
