# MATLAB&#174; DocMaker :hatching_chick:

DocMaker is a tool for generating MATLAB toolbox documentation.

With DocMaker, you can:
* write documentation in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) and convert to HTML for viewing in MATLAB
* run MATLAB code blocks in documents and include textual and graphical output
* create MATLAB documentation index files from a Markdown table of contents

This is DocMaker version 0.7.  The [release notes](changelog.md) detail new features, bug fixes, and compatibility considerations for each version.

## Getting started

### System requirements

DocMaker requires [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/matlab-system-requirements.html) R2021a or later to *generate* documentation.

[`docconvert`](docconvert.md) and [`docindex`](docindex.md) require network access to a GitHub or GitLab instance to process Markdown documents and generate DocMaker artifacts.

Documentation generated by DocMaker can be *viewed* in much older releases of MATLAB, and offline.

### Installation

DocMaker is distributed as a MATLAB toolbox file (`.mltbx`).  See the MATLAB documentation for [instructions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-and-share-custom-matlab-toolboxes.html) on installing and uninstalling toolboxes.

By default, DocMaker uses the GitHub Markdown API at `api.github.com` to convert Markdown to HTML.  You can [configure Markdown conversion](conversion.md) to:

* use another converter technology
* use another service instance
* authenticate with an access token.

## Working with DocMaker

### Writing documentation

Write documentation in Markdown using your favorite editor.  Include code, images, and links.  You can use the DocMaker documentation as inspiration for your own documentation!

Include MATLAB code blocks using ` ```matlab ` fenced code blocks.  Typically, you want to evaluate MATLAB code blocks and insert the output into the documentation.  To designate a MATLAB code block as for *display only*, not evaluation, add trailing whitespace to the last line.

Write a table of contents called `helptoc.md`, also in Markdown.  This document should contain:
* a level-1 heading `# Heading` with the name of the toolbox
* a nested list of links to your Markdown documents

For example:

```md
# Ducks Toolbox

* [Getting started](index.md)
  * [Huey](huey.md)
  * [Louie](louie.md)
  * [Dewey](dewey.md)
```

If you need a list item to group child items, specify an empty link URL, e.g. `* [Function reference]()`.  Other content in `helptoc.md` -- including additional links and normal text in list items -- is ignored by but harmless to [`docindex`](docindex.md).

### Publishing documentation

First, use [`docconvert`](docconvert.md) to convert your Markdown documents to HTML.  Next, use [`docrun`](docrun.md) to run MATLAB code blocks in the HTML documents and insert textual and graphical output.  Finally, use [`docindex`](docindex.md) to generate documentation index files.  Here is a complete example, to generate the DocMaker documentation:

```matlab
docconvert tbx/docmakerdoc/**/*.md
docrun tbx/docmakerdoc/**/*.html
docindex tbx/docmakerdoc 
```

Before you start, you may wish to delete previous DocMaker artifacts using [`docdelete`](docdelete.md).

### Automating the process

You can incorporate documentation into your software delivery pipeline by integrating DocMaker with MATLAB [build automation](automation.md) technologies.
