## Contributors

DocMaker is developed by [David Sampson](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/16247) at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting.html).

DocMaker uses the [GitHub Markdown API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/markdown) at [github.com](https://docs.github.com/), and the [GitHub Markdown CSS](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus).

The author thanks [Ken Deeley](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2987674) from MathWorks for his support during the development of DocMaker.

## History

The [release notes](changelog.md) detail new features, bug fixes, and compatibility considerations for each version.

DocMaker replaces a previous MathWorks internal documentation tool, *DocTools*, by [Ben Tordoff](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1297191).  DocMaker seeks to improve on DocTools by supporting authoring in Markdown.

DocMaker was developed to build documentation for [GUI Layout Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox), [Package Jockey](https://insidelabs-git.mathworks.com/dsampson/pj), and [DocMaker](https://github.com/mathworks/docmaker) itself!  The features of DocMaker reflect the needs of these projects.
