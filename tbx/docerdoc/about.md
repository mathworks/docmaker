# About Doc'er :hippopotamus:

## Release notes

Doc'er is currently under development, with an initial release planned for Q3 2024.

## Contributors

Doc'er was developed by [David Sampson](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/16247) at [MathWorks](https://uk.mathworks.com/services/consulting.html).

Doc'er uses the [GitHub Markdown API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/markdown) at [github.com](https://docs.github.com/), and the [GitHub Markdown CSS](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus).

The author thanks [Ken Deeley](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2987674) from MathWorks for his encouragement during the development of Doc'er.

## History

Doc'er replaces a previous MathWorks internal documentation tool, *DocTools*, by [Ben Tordoff](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1297191).  Doc'er seeks to improve on DocTools by supporting authoring in Markdown and leveraging the Markdown ecosystem.

Doc'er was developed to build documentation for [GUI Layout Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox) and [Package Jockey](https://insidelabs-git.mathworks.com/dsampson/pj).  The features of Doc'er reflect the needs of these projects.

## Doc'er (disambiguation)

Doc'er is pronounced the same as, but not to be confused with, [Docker :whale:](https://docs.docker.com/).
