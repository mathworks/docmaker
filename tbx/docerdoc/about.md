# About Doc_er :hatching_chick:

## Contributors

Doc_er is developed by [David Sampson](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/16247) at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting.html).

Doc_er uses the [GitHub Markdown API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/markdown) at [github.com](https://docs.github.com/), and the [GitHub Markdown CSS](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus).

The author thanks [Ken Deeley](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2987674) from MathWorks for his encouragement during the development of Doc_er.

## History

The [release notes](changelog.md) detail new features, bug fixes, and compatibility considerations for each version.

Doc_er replaces a previous MathWorks internal documentation tool, *DocTools*, by [Ben Tordoff](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1297191).  Doc_er seeks to improve on DocTools by supporting authoring in Markdown.

Doc_er was developed to build documentation for [GUI Layout Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox), [Package Jockey](https://insidelabs-git.mathworks.com/dsampson/pj), and [Doc_er](https://insidelabs-git.mathworks.com/dsampson/docer) itself!  The features of Doc_er reflect the needs of these projects.

## Doc_er (disambiguation)

The "doc" in "Doc_er" stands for "documentation".

Doc_er is pronounced the same as, but should not be confused with, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) :whale:.
