# About DocStar :hatching_chick:

## Contributors

DocStar is developed by [David Sampson](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/16247) at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting.html).

DocStar uses the [GitHub Markdown API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/markdown) at [github.com](https://docs.github.com/), and the [GitHub Markdown CSS](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus).

The author thanks [Ken Deeley](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2987674) from MathWorks for his encouragement during the development of DocStar.

## History

The [release notes](changelog.md) detail new features, bug fixes, and compatibility considerations for each version.

DocStar replaces a previous MathWorks internal documentation tool, *DocTools*, by [Ben Tordoff](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1297191).  DocStar seeks to improve on DocTools by supporting authoring in Markdown.

DocStar was developed to build documentation for [GUI Layout Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox), [Package Jockey](https://insidelabs-git.mathworks.com/dsampson/pj), and [DocStar](https://insidelabs-git.mathworks.com/dsampson/docstar) itself!  The features of DocStar reflect the needs of these projects.

## DocStar (disambiguation)

The "doc" in "DocStar" stands for "documentation".

DocStar is pronounced the same as, but should not be confused with, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) :whale:.
